# JavaScrpit-Quiz

## Page displays a quiz app that will run through 4 questions, showing the user whether their answer was correct or not for each question

## App should time user with only 45 seconds for the entire quiz
## If user gets a question wrong, 10 seconds should be subtracted from the time
## If the user runs out of time, the app should jump to the Results Page

## The results page should display the user's score & allow them to save their score with their initials
## Then user should be able to see all highscores

## Current Issues with App:
### Time refreshes each time the user moves to a new question
### Time is not getting subtracted when user answers wrong
### Highscores are not appearing after the user saves them on the Results Page
